# Tools I Recommend

## IDE
| Tool (with Link) | Cost | What Is It? | Why I Like It & Other Notes |
|--|--|--|--|
| **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)** | Free | Development Environment | An incredibly capable IDE with lots of bells and whistles (and extensions), I'm a huge fan--particularly of that price tag.  Also available [as a web app](https://vscode.dev) entirely in-browser |

## Documentation

| Tool (with Link) | Cost | What Is It? | Why I Like It & Other Notes |
|--|--|--|--|
| **[Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)** | Free | Documentation-as-Code | Programmatically generated diagrams and visuals, anyone?  GitLab supports it, GitHub just announced support in 2022 |

## API Development

| Tool (with Link) | Cost | Why I Like it | Other Notes |
|--|--|--|--|
| **[Postman](https://getpostman.com)** | Free for 3 users & 5 integrations | API Development, Testing, Developing Against APIs | Once my favorite tool, still solid--but has fallen in my estimation as it's pricing for businesses has risen.  *$99/user/mo* for IAM and SCIM provisioning?  C'mon Postman, get real and don't lock security features behind outrageous paywalls! |
| **[Stoplight.io](https://stoplight.io)** | Free for 3 users & 2 projects | API Design, Mocking, Documentation | |
